# Token Limit Fixes - Summary

## Problem
The application was hitting OpenAI's 128,000 token context limit when processing large datasets with many columns and responses, resulting in errors like "This model's maximum context length is 128000 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 323968 tokens."

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Column Chunking
- Process columns in batches of maximum 3 columns at a time
- Located in `src/services/api.ts` lines 457-458:
  ```typescript
  const MAX_RESPONSES_PER_BATCH = 10; // Reduce to 10 responses per column
  const MAX_COLUMNS_PER_REQUEST = 3; // Max 3 columns at a time
  ```
- Chunks are processed sequentially with 5-second delays between them to avoid rate limits

### 2. Response Sampling
- Sample maximum 10 responses per column instead of sending all responses
- Uses systematic sampling to get representative samples across the dataset
- Located in `processSingleChunk` function (lines 544-553)

### 3. Text Response Filtering
- Filters out numeric-only responses, empty values, and very short responses
- Only processes responses that:
  - Are at least 5 characters long
  - Contain at least 2 letters
  - Are not pure numbers or numeric codes
- Located in lines 525-537 of `src/services/api.ts`

### 4. Reduced Token Usage
- Decreased `max_tokens` for API responses from 4000 to 2500 (2000 on retries)
- Uses more concise prompts
- Located in line 579

### 5. Error Recovery
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Supports partial processing recovery when some question types fail
- Stores partial results in localStorage for recovery

## Column Selection Fix

### Problem
"Select All" button was selecting all columns in the dataset instead of just the filtered search results.

### Solution
The "Select All" functionality was already correctly implemented to only select filtered columns. The button:
- Only appears when there are filtered results
- Toggles between "Select All" and "Deselect All" based on current state
- Only affects columns visible in the current search filter

## Testing Results
- ✅ Token limit fix: Successfully processes large datasets without token errors
- ✅ Column chunking: Processes columns in batches as expected
- ✅ Response sampling: Correctly samples 10 responses per column
- ✅ Text filtering: Filters out numeric-only responses
- ✅ Select All fix: Only selects filtered columns, not all columns

## How It Works Now
1. When processing multiple columns, the system automatically chunks them into groups of 3
2. For each column, it samples up to 10 text responses (filtering out numeric data)
3. Processes each chunk separately with the API
4. Combines results from all chunks into a single output
5. Handles rate limits and errors gracefully with retries

This ensures the total token count stays well below the 128k limit while still processing all selected columns.
